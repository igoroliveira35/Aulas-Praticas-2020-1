		Deep down in Jamaica, close to Mandeville<br>
		Back up in the woods, on top of a hill<br>
		There stood an old hut made of earth and wood<br>
		There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode<br>
		He never learned to read and a-write so well<br>
		But he could play his guitar like ringing a bell, yell<br><br>
		And said, "Go, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight, " yeah<br>
		And said, "Go, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode"<br><br>
		He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack<br>
		Sitting in a tree in the railroad track<br>
		Old engineer in the train sitting in the shade<br>
		Strummin' with the rhythm that them drivers made<br>
		People passing by would stop and say<br>
		Oh my, oh my, what the boy can play<br><br>
		I said, "Oh, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight, " yeah<br>
		Said, "Oh oh, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode"<br><br>
		Mama said: Son, you gotta be a man (gona out, be a man)<br>
		You gotta be the leader of a reggae band<br>
		People coming in from miles around<br>
		To hear you play until the sun goes down<br>
		Boy, someday, your name will be in the lights<br>
		Saying: Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight<br><br>
		I said, "Oh, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight, " yeah<br>
		Said, "Oh oh, go Johnny, Johnny you better be good"<br>
		I said, "Go, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br>
		Play Johnny, "Go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode"<br>
		I said, "Go, go, go, go, go Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight"<br>
		You can hear him play, go Johnny, better be good
